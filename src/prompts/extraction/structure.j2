## Analysis Instructions

1. **Sections**: Identify the hierarchical structure of sections
   - Level 1: Main sections/chapters
   - Level 2: Subsections
   - Level 3+: Sub-subsections
   
2. **Tables**: Note any tables found (provide title if visible)

3. **Table of Contents**: Does this document have a TOC?

4. **Section Content**: For each section, extract a brief summary of what it contains

Build a clean hierarchical structure that represents the document organization.
